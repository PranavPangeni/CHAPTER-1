            <h2>Data:</h2>
            <p>Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts and figures without context. It can be in various forms such as numbers, text, images, or sounds. On its own, data lacks meaning and requires processing to become useful information.</p>

                    <p>A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information. A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that helps in creating, managing, and manipulating databases. It serves as an interface between the database and its users or application programs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Reduced redundancy, data consistency, easy access and management, enhanced security, backup and recovery options.</p>
                    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> High cost, complexity, system failure risk, requires technical expertise, performance overhead for small datasets.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Hierarchical Model:</strong> This model organizes data in a tree-like structure where each record has a single parent and can have multiple children.
                            <br><strong>Advantages:</strong> Fast access, simplicity.
                            <br><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Complex to manage many-to-many relationships.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Network Model:</strong> Data is represented as records connected by links in a graph, allowing more complex relationships.
                            <br><strong>Advantages:</strong> Supports complex relationships.
                            <br><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Difficult to design and maintain.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Relational Model:</strong> Data is stored in tables (relations), and relationships are represented through foreign keys.
                            <br><strong>Advantages:</strong> Flexibility, SQL support.
                            <br><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Slower performance for very large data sets.

                    <h3>What is a relational database? How is it different from other database models?</h3>
                    <p>A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables consisting of rows and columns. It uses relational algebra and SQL for querying and managing data. The relationships between tables are established through primary and foreign keys.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>What is data redundancy? How does DBMS help in reducing it?</h3>
                    <p>Data redundancy occurs when the same data is stored in multiple places. DBMS reduces redundancy through normalization and relational models, ensuring each piece of information is stored once and referenced elsewhere using keys.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Define normalization. Explain 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF with suitable examples.</h3>
                    <p>Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy. 
                    <br><strong>1NF:</strong> Eliminate repeating groups.
                    <br><strong>2NF:</strong> Eliminate partial dependency.
                    <br><strong>3NF:</strong> Eliminate transitive dependency.</p>
                    <p>Example: 
                    <br>Unnormalized: ID, Name, Courses
                    <br>1NF: Split courses into separate rows.
                    <br>2NF: Separate tables for courses and students.
                    <br>3NF: Ensure non-key fields depend only on the primary key.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Explain the terms: primary key, foreign key, and candidate key with examples.</h3>
                    <p><strong>Primary Key:</strong> A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each record. For example, in a Student table, StudentID is a primary key.
                    <br><strong>Foreign Key:</strong> A foreign key is a column that creates a relationship between two tables by referring to the primary key of another table. For example, CourseID in the Enrollment table may refer to CourseID in the Course table.
                    <br><strong>Candidate Key:</strong> Field(s) A candidate key is any column or set of columns that can serve as a primary key. For example, in a table with columns StudentID, Email, and PhoneNumber, both Email and StudentID can be candidate keys if they contain unique values.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>What is SQL? Explain its components and common functions.</h3>
                    <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized language used to manage relational databases. It enables users to create, read, update, and delete data.
                    <br><strong>Components:</strong> DDL (CREATE, ALTER), DML (INSERT, SELECT), DCL (GRANT, REVOKE), TCL (COMMIT, ROLLBACK).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Define the following terms:</h3>
